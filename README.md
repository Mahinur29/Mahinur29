## Hello there! 👋


I am an undergraduate student in Istanbul University in Faculty of science, Molecular Biology Department. Here are couple more about me!

- 🪧 I’m currently on my third class, sixth semester. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working voluntarily in a plant biotechnology lab and gaining lab experience. 
- 🧟‍♀️I want to take my place in the scientific world as a bioinformatician.
- 🧬I am particularly interested in nature of the things -especially living things, which eventually lead me to the microworld of cells and genome.
- 💻 I learned basics of python language, tkinter programming and a bunch of other programs in the beginner level (such as numpy, matplotlib, biopython etc.) 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with experiencing more about omics and bioinformatic analysis. And any oppurtunity to reinforce what I've learned in last few years. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything, guarantee for nothing though
- 📫 How to reach me: mahinur@uygur.com
- 😄 Pronouns: you choose
- 🔮 Fun fact: Even if the time machines exists, we would never be able to meet our future self. Meaning we only exist in now and the past? Or, do we really create our what we're gonna be? Exhausting this living thing is!
